# Look At Me Sideways (LAMS)

![>_>](docs/img/logo.png)

LAMS is a style guide and linter for [Looker](https://looker.com/)'s LookML data modeling language. It is designed to help a team of developers to produce more maintainable LookML projects.

- The [style guide](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/rules.html) alone can help your project, even without enforcement by the linter.
- The linter can be configured to enforce rules from the style guide for all commits to your master branch.
- The linter also allows you to conveniently specify custom rules to enforce.
- In addition to enforcing rules, the linter also produces markdown files to help developers navigate the project.

## Deployment

### Interactive Usage

To use LAMS with the least overhead for simple interactive local use and testing:

```bash
npm install -g @looker/look-at-me-sideways
cd <your-lookml-project>
lams
```

(We will be publishing LAMS to NPM shortly after its release to simplify the above)

### Docker

Although LAMS can be deployed manually using your CI tool of choice, we have provided a Docker image to simplify the deployment. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/looker-open-source/look-at-me-sideways/blob/master/docker/README.md).

### Manifest.lkml (optional)

If your LookML project doesn't have a manifest.lkml file, you may want to consider adding one! By specifying a 'project_name' in your manifest, LAMS will be able to generate the correct links back to your project files in your instance.

## Linter Features

### Ruleset Support

As of the current release, the Linter enforces rules K1-4, F1-4, E1-2, and T1-10.

It currently does not resolve `extends` references, so if you are complying with a rule via extension, use a rule exemption as noted below.

### Rule Exemption

One of the best practices required by the style guide is that whenever a rule is not followed, the reason should be documented in a LookML comment. In fact, the linter accepts a specific format for these exemption reasons to allow them to be checked:

```lkml
view: rollup {
  derived_table: {
    sql_trigger_value: SELECT CURRENT_DATE() ;;
    # LAMS
    # rule_exemptions: {
    #  T1: "2018-11-12 - I can't use datagroups for this super special reason and Bob said it's ok"
    # }
    sql: SELECT ...
```

If you want to entirely opt-out of checking a particular rule, you can specify the exemptions in your project's manifest.lkml file. See [Customizing LAMS](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/customizing-lams)

Note: For large projects with many exemptions, we suggest starting the reasons with the Y-M-D formatted date on which they were added, for easier review in your issue report.

### Generated Markdown Files

One of the primary ways that LAMS gives developers feedback, in addition to passing/failing pull requests, is by adding its findings to markdown files in your project. Here is an example of a resulting markdown file as displayed in Looker:

### Customizing LAMS

In addition to linting against its style guide, LAMS also lets you disable rules or specify your own rules. See [Customizing LAMS](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/customizing-lams) .
