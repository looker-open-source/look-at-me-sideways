<h1>LAMS Style Guide</h1>
<p>This is a style guide for <a href="https://www.looker.com/">Looker</a>'s LookML data modeling language. This style guide, as well as the associated <a href="https://github.com/looker-open-source/look-at-me-sideways">linter, Look At Me Sideways (LAMS)</a>, are designed to help make your LookML project more maintainable.</p>
<p>These rules are opinionated, and might imply significant changes to a LookML project that has been developed organically. We've tried to provide rationales throughout so you can come to your own conclusions. However, at their core, these rules are about making your LookML and SQL reusable, self-explanatory, and reliable.</p>
<p>Note that the LAMS linter does not fully implement the style guide. Rules that are provided below, but which are not implemented in the style guide are marked with a 💬. Some may be "not yet implemented", whereas others may be more qualitative in nature and intended only for human consideration.</p>

<h1 id="key-dimensions">Key Dimensions</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Implement consistent dimensions to communicate information about views' keys to developers who use the view</p>
<details id="k1"> <!-- Primary key naming -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k1">K1.</a></b> Views should define 1 or more "Primary Key Dimensions" following a naming convention of <code>pk{n}_{key_name}</code>...</summary>

	<p>..., where n is the total number of columns that form the primary key, and which may be omitted if it is 1, and key_name is any descriptive name.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> This applies to "regular" views that describe an underlying table, i.e. through a <code>sql_table_name</code>, <code>derived_table</code>, or implicit table name. In some cases, you may have a "field-only view", which would be joined using `<code>join: {sql: ;;}</code>`, for which this rule would not apply.</p>

	<p><b>Rationale:</b> With this naming convention, anyone creating a join can conclusively find the correct logic without having to investigate:</p>

	<img src="img/pk-dimension-suggested.png" width="381" height="117" />

	<p>Additionally, anyone reading the join could conclusively verify it. </p>

	<code class="bad block">
	view: carriers {
		sql_table_name: faa.carriers ;;
		dimension: carrier_id {
			hidden: yes
			primary_key: yes
			sql:${TABLE}.id;;
		}
	}
	# ^ Altough `primary_key: yes` is used, the 
	# naming convention has not been followed

	explore: flights {
		join: carriers {
			relationship: many_to_one
			sql_on: ${carriers.carrier_id}
					= ${flights.carrier_id} ;;

			# ^ is this logic right? I
			# would need to inspect the
			# view definition to confirm
		}
	}
  	</code>

	<code class="block good">
	view: carriers {
		sql_table_name: faa.carriers ;;
		dimension: pk1_carrier_id {
			hidden: yes
			primary_key: yes
			sql:${TABLE}.id;;
		}
	}

	explore: flights {
		join: carriers {
			relationship: many_to_one
			sql_on: ${carriers.pk1_carrier_id}
					= ${flights.carrier_id} ;;
			  
			# ^ I know the join cardinality 
			# must be correct because I see it's
			# joining on the primary key
		}
	}
  	</code>

	<code class="block good">
	# Example of a composite primary key

		sql_table_name: membership ;;
		dimension: pk2_user_id {
			hidden:yes
			sql:${TABLE}.user_id;;

		dimension: pk2_group_id {
			hidden:yes
			sql:${TABLE}.group_id;;
		}
		dimension: user_x_group {

	}

	explore: invitations {
		join: membership {
		relationship: many_to_one
		sql_on: ${membership.pk2_user_id}
				= ${invitations.to_user_id}
			AND ${membership.pk2_group_id}
				= ${invitations.group_id} ;;
		# ^ I can tell there MUST be only one membership
		# for each row from the left table. Looks good.
		}
	}

	explore: users {
		join: membership {
		relationship: many_to_one
		sql_on: ${membership.pk2_user_id} = ${users.id} ;;

		# ^ Without even examining the view, I can
		# tell that something is wrong here!
		# (And rule E2 can check this for me)
		}
	}
	</code>

	<h5>Notes</h5>

	<ul>
	<li> The number can (and must) be 0 in the rare case that you are working with a table with no primary key.</li>
	<li> The name should be descriptive outside of the context of the view. So, prefer <code>pk1_account_id</code> over <code>pk1_id</code>. This way, views that logically share one or more primary keys can be recognized.</li>
	<li> For keys with more than one column, all the numbers should be equal to the total number of columns. So, <code>pk3_a</code>, <code>pk3_b</code>, and <code>pk3_c</code>, NOT <code>pk1_a</code>, <code>pk1_b</code>, and <code>pk1_c</code>.</li>
	<li> For keys with more than one column, this does mean you would need to define it in two ways. Once this way, and once as a single concatenated dimension with <code>primary_key: yes</code> (if necessary) so Looker can use it for generating symmetric aggregates. This is a small price to pay for the many instances of time saved looking up primary key information when writing/reading explores.</li>
	<li> An earlier version of these guidelines specified a naming convention starting with <code>{n}pk</code>. This has been changed to reflect the fact that many databases do not allow column names to start with a number.</li>
	</ul>

	</details>
<details id="k3"> <!-- Primary key location -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k3">K3.</a></b> Primary Key Dimensions should be defined immediately following the table definition...</summary>
	<p>... and the table definition should be defined before any other dimensions.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By placing primary keys immediately below a derived table definition, users viewing the view file can more easily verify that the Primary Key Dimensions match the derived table's actual primary keys.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k4"> <!-- Primary key hidden -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k4">K4.</a></b> Primary Keys Dimensions should be hidden</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The audience for PK information is developers. They use it to inform how to join and consume tables, and they can do so equally well with a hidden field.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If a column that is a primary key should be user facing, you may want to expose it via a separate dimension.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k7"> <!-- Provide one `primary_key` -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k7">K7.</a></b> Views should declare exactly one <code>primary_key</code> dimension</summary>
	<p>...unless the view declares that it has no primary key via a <code>pk0_</code> named dimension.</p>
	<code class="bad block">
		# Missing a primary_key:yes dimension

		view: users {
			sql_table_name: users ;;
		}

	<code class="good block">
		view: users {
			sql_table_name: users ;;
			dimension: pk1_user_id {
				primary_key: yes
				hidden: yes
				sql: ${TABLE}.user_id ;;

		</code>
	<code class="bad block">
		# Too many primary_key:yes dimensions

		view: users {
			sql_table_name: users ;;
			dimension: pk1_user_id {
				primary_key: yes
				hidden: yes

				primary_key: yes
				sql: ${TABLE}.user_id ;;
			}
		}
		</code>
	<code class="good block">
		view: log_events {
			sql_table_name: log_events ;;
			dimension: pk0_user_id {
				hidden: yes

	</details>
<details id="k8"> <!-- primary_key dim uses all PK dims -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k8">K8.</a></b> The <code>primary_key</code> dimension must use or be the Primary Key Dimension(s)</summary>
	<p>In the case of a simple, 1-column primary key, this simply means the Primary Key Dimension and the <code>primary_key:yes</code> dimension are the same dimension</p>

	<code class="good block">
		view: users {
			sql_table_name: users ;;
			dimension: pk1_user_id {
				primary_key: yes
				hidden: yes
				sql: ${TABLE}.user_id ;;
			}
		}
		</code>
	<p>However, for composite primary keys, you should ensure that the <code>primary_key:yes</code> dimension uses all of the Primary Key Dimensions in its <code>sql</code>:</p>

	<code class="good block">
		view: memberships {
			sql_table_name: memberships ;;
			dimension: pk2_user_id {
				hidden: yes
				sql: ${TABLE}.user_id ;;
			}
			dimension: pk2_group_id {
				hidden: yes
				sql: ${TABLE}.group_id ;;
			}
			dimension: membership_id {
				hidden: yes
				primary_key: yes
				sql: ${pk2_user_id} || "-" || ${pk2_group_id} ;;
			}
		}
		</code>
	</details>
<details id="k5"> <!-- Distribution dimensions -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k5">K5.</a></b> Views based on tables with a <a class="subtle" href="#glossary-dist-key">distribution key</a> should define a Distribution Key Dimension... 💬</summary>
	<p>...named like <code>pkd_{key_name}</code></p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By naming it similarly to Primary Keys, it will be suggested to anyone joining on a view as a possible join key. At the same time, the use of a `d` instead of a number allows it to be differentiated from a primary key</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If your database supports multiple projections of data, you may want to come up with a more sophisticated naming scheme instead.</p>
	</details>
<details id="k6"> <!-- Sort/cluster dimensions -->
	<summary><b><a href="#k6">K6.</a></b> Views based on tables with a <a class="subtle" href="#glossary-sort-key">sort/cluster key</a> should define one or more Sort/Cluster Key Dimensions 💬</summary>
	<p>...named like <code>pkc_{key_name}</code></p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By naming it similarly to Primary Keys, it will be suggested to anyone joining on a view as a possible join key. At the same time, the use of a `c` instead of a number allows it to be differentiated from a primary key</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The name for this concept varies greatly from database to database. "pkc" was chosen for cluster, in favor of "pks" which could be read as a "surrogate key".</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If you have compound cluster/sort keys, it would be a good idea to include the rank of each column in the dimension name. Unlike the PK naming convention, each column should get a different numner, e.g. <code>pkc1_site, pkc2_date, pkc3_country</code>.</p>
	</details>

<h1 id="other-fields">Other Fields</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Implement fields in ways which (a) maximize the ability of developers to reuse them in the future, and (b) maximize the usability of explores for end users</p>
<details id="f1"> <!-- No inter-view dependencies -->
	<summary><b><a href="#f1">F1.</a></b> Fields in a view should not reference other views...</summary>
	<p>... unless this is (A) a field-only view, or (B) a tightly coupled view (provide a base explore too!)</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Inter-view dependencies interfere with the re-use of the view<p>
	<code class="block bad">
	view: users {...}
	view: orders {
	  ...
	  measure: orders_per_user {
	    sql: ${count} / NULLIF(${users.count},0)

	    view_label: "Orders" #For cleaner explore UI
	  }
	}
	</code>
	</details>
<details id="f2"> <!-- No view-labeled fields -->
	<summary><b><a href="#f2">F2.</a></b> Fields should not contain a <code>view_label</code>.</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Field-level view labels can't be overridden by a join. Prefer view-level view labels.</p>
	</details>
<details id="f3"> <!-- Count fields filtered -->
	<summary><b><a href="#f3">F3.</a></b> All type:count measures should specify a filter</summary>
	<p>"Plain" count fields can/should specify a filter of "primary key dimensions (or any non-nullable field) are not null"</p>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> By default Looker will implement any non-filtered & non-distinct count field as a `COUNT(*)`. Filtering such "plain" counts on PK IS NOT NULL ensures correct counts in all of the following uses of the field: Counting just that table, counting that table when joined on as a one-to-one-or-zero table, counting that table with symmetric aggregates when joined on as a many_to_one table, and counting that table in explores with join paths.</b>
	<code class="block good">
	measure: count {
		type: count
		filters:{
			field: pk1_user_id
			value: "NOT NULL"
		}
	}
	</code>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The <a href="https://docs.looker.com/reference/filter-expressions">LookML filter syntax</a> for "is not null" varies depending on the type of the field. For strings, use <code>-NULL</code>. For numbers, use <code>NOT NULL</code>.</p>
	</details>
<details id="f4"> <!-- Description or hidden -->
	<summary><b><a href="#f4">F4.</a></b> Non-hidden fields should have descriptions</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> User experience. Just do it.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Think about the audience when you write a description. Information for end users can go in the description, whereas information for other developers can go in a LookML comment</p>
	</details>
<details id="f5"> <!-- ID fields hidden -->
	<summary><b><a href="#f5">F5.</a></b> ID fields that do not have a business usage should be hidden 💬</summary>
	<code class="good block">
	view: order_items { ... pk1_order_item_id {hidden:yes}}

	</details>
<details id="f6"> <!-- FK ID fields hidden -->
	<summary><b><a href="#f6">F6.</a></b> ID fields that DO have a business usage should still be hidden when they are a foreign key 💬</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> The ID field will make most sense for end users when they are exposed under the view for which they are a primary key.</p>
	<code class="bad block">
	view: order_items { ... dimension: order_id { ... description: "..." } }
	view: orders { ... dimension: id { ... hidden:yes }}

	view: orders { ... dimension: id {... description: "..." }}
	</code>
	</details>

<h1 id="derived-tables">Derived Tables</h1>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Restrict the ways in which you write the SQL for derived tables in order to make them more modular and their results more realiable and understandable.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> These rules may seem hard to comply with at first. Although they may represent a large change from your usual way of writing SQL, the change also brings a large positive impact.</p>
<details id="t1"> <!-- Triggers use datagroups -->
	<summary><b><a href="#t1">T1.</a></b> Triggered PDTs should use datagroups</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> <code>sql_trigger_value</code> is an older construct and can have subtle timing issues when multiple tables interact.</p>
	</details>
<details id="t2"> <!-- Primary keys required -->
	<summary><b><a href="#t2">T2.</a></b> Every derived table, CTE, or subquery should SELECT a set of primary key columns</summary>
	<p><b>Rationale:</b> Primary keys define a contract that allows anyone reviewing the logic of a query to evaluate it modularly.
	Without them, any attempt to troubleshoot a query requires an arbitrarily deep investigation of related subqueries.
	With them, each query and subquery can be evaluated independently against their declared PK and the declared PK's of the participating tables.</p>
