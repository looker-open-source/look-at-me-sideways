# v4.0

⚡ icons below indicate breaking changes.

- Adds a new output method, `github-markdown` for GitHub users

- ⚡ The underlying LookML representation has removed the additional "model" object inserted into the top-level of model files. Any custom rules that attempted to match this construct should be updated. For most use cases, using the top-level (non-file) model object is recommended.
- ⚡ The underlying LookML representation has removed the ancestry metadata (e.g. $model, $view, $explore) added to child objects. Any custom rules that used this information should instead source it from the `path` argument.
