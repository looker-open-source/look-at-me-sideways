# v3.0

## v3 Prologue

V3 of LAMS is a relatively straightforward but major change that opts in to many of the underlying LookML Parser's output options that have accumulated over time: whitespace awareness, extension/refinement support, and a simplified file representation.

The primary impact will be to LAMS users who have implemented [custom rules](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/customizing-lams), who may have to update their rules for the updated LookML representations.

Usage of LAMS that only uses the "out of the box" style guide rules should not see a large impact, except that some rules may now work correctly based on extensions/refinements, whereas they may have thrown "false positive" errors previously because the parser did not apply any extensions/refinements.

## Highlighted changes

- **Extensions/refinements awareness:** LAMS now support the abilities to lint over logical declarations that are the result of extends/refinements, rather than only lexical declarations. All rules except T2-10 have been updated to check extended/refined objects. In addition, custom rules can take advantage of this - since extension/refinements work at the model scope, these representations can be found under the `model` construct. The `file` construct continues to provide the lexical / "as written" representation. 
- **Whitespace/comment awareness available:** Rules may now elect to evaluate whitespace by looking at the `$strings` property within each object. An initial built-in rule pertaining to whitespce, W1, is also included in the initial release as an example.
- **File representation simplification:** Files were previously represented as an array. The ordering was not particularly significant. The lack of a meaningful key made the location returned in custom rules opaque and necessitated workarounds. Now, files are represented by an object, keyed by the filepath.

## Changelist
- Parser updates
	- Opting in to `$strings` whitespace data
	- Opting in to "by name" file output mode 
	- Opting in to extensions/refinements
- Built-in rule updates
	- F1: Rule F1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- F2: Rule F2 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- F3: Rule F3 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- F4: Rule F4 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- K1: Rule K1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models. It now also contains logic that was previously identified as K2.
	- K2: Rule identifier K2 is deprecated, and its rule logic is applied under K1.
	- K3: Rule K3 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- K4: Rule K4 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- T1: Rule T1 previously evaluated over view declarations in view files. It now evaluates over assembled views in models.
	- W1: Rule W1 is added as an initial rule demonstrating the ability to operate on whitespace.
- JSON Path library update
	- The JSON Path library has been migrated from `jsonpath`, which was rarely maintained, to `jsonpath-plus`. This is primarily to address the old library's failure to correctly match union expressions, which were a common use case for expressions like `$.model.*['dimension','measure'].*`
	- Javascript expressions within path components are strictly limited to a single existence check or equality check against a literal

## Migration Guidelines

For any error not detailed below, please submit an issue!

- If you are providing any custom rules that iterate over file matches
	- Change your match from `$.files.*` to `$.file.*`. Note that the path/location will now contain the filename.
- If you have newly-erroring views that were previously unchecked due to their being declared in a non-view file
	- You may wish to update the view to comply with the style guide, or apply exemptions for the relevant rule(s)
